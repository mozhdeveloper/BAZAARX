# BAZAARX — AI Assistant Standard

## Project Context

- **Project**: BAZAARX — a full-stack marketplace platform
- **Developer**: Full-stack developer (sole owner of all decisions)
- **Stack**: React.js + Vite (web), Expo React Native (mobile), Supabase (backend/database)
- **Structure**: `web/` (web app), `mobile-app/` (mobile app), `supabase/` (database/functions)

---

## Global Rules (Apply to Every Prompt)

- Keep implementations **simple** — do not over-architect
- Make **only the changes requested** — do not refactor unrelated code
- Do **not** add unnecessary comments, docstrings, or type annotations to untouched code
- Do **not** create new files unless strictly necessary — prefer editing existing files
- Always consider **security** (OWASP Top 10) and **accessibility** in every change
- Never start implementation without the developer's explicit permission when a plan is involved
- When in doubt, **ask** before assuming scope

---

## Workflow: When to Use Each Standard

### Planning a Feature or Change → Follow `plan.md`

When the request involves designing, scoping, or planning new functionality:

1. Read `plan.md` for the full planning standard
2. Output the plan into `/docs/plans/<requirement_name>.plan.md`
3. Iterate with the developer until the plan is approved
4. **Do NOT implement until given permission**

### Implementing / Generating Code → Follow `codegen.md`

When the request involves writing, modifying, or generating actual code:

1. Read `codegen.md` for the full code generation standard
2. Work step-by-step through the implementation plan (if one exists)
3. Limit changes to **no more than 20 files per step**
4. End each step with a summary and any required user instructions

---

## Project Conventions

- Environment variables live in `.env` — never commit them
- Supabase migrations go in `supabase-migrations/`
- Shared documentation goes in `docs/`
- Plans go in `docs/plans/`
- Always validate against the existing database schema before modifying Supabase queries
- Mobile and web share Supabase as the single source of truth — keep logic consistent across both

---

## Files Excluded from Git

The following files are local AI standards and are **never committed**:

- `general.md`
- `plan.md`
- `codegen.md`

## Session Log — March 9, 2026

### Feature — Seller `notifySellerOrderReceived` + Seller Badge Real-Time Subscriptions

**Prompt:** Add seller notification when buyer confirms receipt of an order. Fix seller notification badge to update in real-time.

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/services/notificationService.ts`
   - Added `notifySellerOrderReceived()` method
2. Web seller badge subscription components
   - Fixed real-time Supabase subscriptions for seller notification badges in web and mobile

---

### Feature — Buyer Notifications: New Messages + Badges (Web + Mobile)

**Prompt:** "Do the same to the buyer's end. Add badge to bell icon AND message icon."

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/services/notificationService.ts`
   - Added `notifyBuyerNewMessage()` method
2. `web/src/services/chatService.ts`
   - Added seller→buyer notification call inside `sendMessage()` so buyer gets notified of new seller messages
3. `web/src/components/Header.tsx`
   - Added Messages icon badge using real-time `subscribeToNotifications` for unread message count
4. `web/src/components/NotificationsDropdown.tsx`
   - Added real-time subscription to auto-refresh on new notifications
   - Added icon style handling for `return` and `message` notification types
5. `web/src/components/OrderDetailsModal.tsx`
   - Fixed confirm action to fire `notifyBuyerOrderStatus` to the DB (not just local state)
6. `web/src/pages/SellerOrders.tsx`
   - Same fix as `OrderDetailsModal` — confirm fires DB notification to buyer
7. `mobile-app/src/components/BuyerBottomNav.tsx`
   - Added Messages badge with 30-second polling for unread message count
8. `mobile-app/App.tsx`
   - Added `tabBarBadge` to the Messages tab using same 30-second interval

---

### Bug Fix — Mobile SellerDrawer Message Badge Not Showing

**Prompt:** "The message notification badge in mobile side bar for seller is not showing."

**Root Cause:** Badge count was fetched only once on mount and never updated. Also, the seller `chatService.getUnreadCount` only queried conversations directly linked to seller ID, missing conversations linked via `products → order_items → orders → conversations`.

**Files Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/src/components/SellerDrawer.tsx`
   - Added real-time Supabase listener for new messages
   - Added refresh trigger when drawer opens (re-fetches badge count on open)
2. `mobile-app/src/services/chatService.ts`
   - Fixed `getUnreadCount` for seller to also query conversations via the `products → order_items → orders → conversations` join path

---

### Bug Fix — Mobile Buyer Notification Routing (Message → Chat, Return → ReturnDetail)

**Prompt:** "In buyer mobile notification, for example notification of new messages when I click it, it is redirecting to different tabs not in messages. Fix all of it."

**Root Cause:** Message notifications were navigating to `Orders` screen. Return notifications were also navigating to `Orders` instead of `ReturnDetail`.

**Files Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/app/NotificationsScreen.tsx`
   - Message notifications (`type.includes('message')`) now look up the conversation by `conversationId` from `action_data` and navigate to `Chat` screen with the correct conversation object
   - Return notifications with a `returnId` now navigate to `ReturnDetail` instead of `Orders`

---

## Session Log — March 10, 2026

### Bug Fix 1 — `OrderDetailPage.tsx:92 "Order not found or access denied"` (Web)

**Prompt:** "Check all the codes that are related to this. Don't change the code I just want you to check in web also it has error: `OrderDetailPage.tsx:92 Order not found or access denied`. Fix all of it."

**Root Cause:**
- `sellerStore.ts` was passing `id.slice(-8)` (a truncated UUID fragment, e.g. `"cf3a4b2e"`) as `orderNumber` to `notifyBuyerOrderStatus`
- `notificationService` stored `action_data.orderNumber = "cf3a4b2e"` and `action_url = "/order/cf3a4b2e"`
- `NotificationsDropdown.tsx` navigated to `/order/cf3a4b2e`
- `orderReadService.getOrderDetail` detected it was not a full UUID → queried `order_number = "cf3a4b2e"` → found no match or a wrong order → returned `null`
- `OrderDetailPage` logged the error and redirected to `/orders`

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/components/NotificationsDropdown.tsx`
   - Changed `handleNotificationClickDb` to prefer `data.orderId` (full UUID, always correct) over `data.orderNumber` for navigation
   - Return notifications (`return_*` type) now use `action_url` directly (which already contains the correct return detail URL)
2. `web/src/stores/sellerStore.ts` (line ~1994)
   - Changed `orderNumber: id.slice(-8)` → `orderNumber: order.orderNumber || id.slice(-8)` so the real DB order number is used when available

**Known Remaining Minor Issue:**
- `web/src/services/orderService.ts` `getOrderNumberLabel()` has a fallback `orderId.substring(0, 8)` — only affects notification display text, not navigation (safe)

---

### Investigation 2 — Cancelled Order Notification Routing (Web, Read-Only)

**Prompt:** "Check all the codes that are related to this. Don't change the code I just want you to check the notifications in web and in buyer cancelled order when I click it, it is directing to different product not the one that is really cancelled."

**Finding:**
- The same root cause as Bug Fix 1 above — the `id.slice(-8)` fragment stored as `orderNumber` could coincidentally match another order's `order_number` column in the DB, causing the wrong order to load
- The two fixes already applied in Bug Fix 1 resolve this as well:
  - `NotificationsDropdown.tsx` now navigates via `data.orderId` (UUID) — always routes to the correct order
  - `sellerStore.ts` now passes the real `order.orderNumber` when available
- No additional code changes were required

---

### Bug Fix 3 — Mobile Seller Notifications — All Icons Were `Bell` (Mobile)

**Prompt:** "Check all the codes that are related to this. Don't change the code I just want you to check the mobile seller, make it similar to other notifications that icons is different from each other. Check the notification code in web for reference. Fix it."

**Root Cause:**
- `mobile-app/app/seller/notifications.tsx` used a hardcoded `<Bell>` icon for every notification card regardless of type
- The buyer `NotificationsScreen.tsx` already had a `getStyles()` helper with per-type icon/color/background logic

**File Changed:**
- `mobile-app/app/seller/notifications.tsx`
  - Added imports: `ShoppingBag`, `XCircle`, `CheckCircle`, `RotateCcw`, `MessageSquare`, `Package`, `Star`, `Truck`
  - Added `getNotificationStyles(type)` helper matching the same pattern as the buyer screen:
    - `new_order` → `ShoppingBag`, green
    - `received` → `CheckCircle`, teal
    - `cancelled` / `cancellation` → `XCircle`, red
    - `return` → `RotateCcw`, orange
    - `message` → `MessageSquare`, purple
    - `product` / `verification` / `sample` → `Package`, indigo
    - `review` → `Star`, amber
    - `shipped` / `delivered` → `Truck`, orange
    - default → `Bell`, gray
  - Updated `renderItem` to call `getNotificationStyles(item.type)` and render a colored + bordered icon circle
  - Removed the static `backgroundColor: '#F3F4F6'` from the `notificationIcon` style (now applied dynamically per type)

## Session Log — March 26, 2026

### Bug Fix — Missing `@shopify/flash-list` Module (Mobile)

**Prompt:** "Fix the problem in the terminal — `Cannot find module '@shopify/flash-list' or its corresponding type declarations.` at `mobile-app/app/HomeScreen.tsx:29`"

**Root Cause:** The `@shopify/flash-list` package was imported but not installed in `mobile-app/package.json`.

**Action Taken:**
- Ran `npm install @shopify/flash-list` in `mobile-app/` directory
- Module now resolves correctly and TypeScript error cleared

---

### UI Refactor — Return / Refund Form Layout Optimization (Web)

**Prompt:** "Make all the form of request return / refund fit in the screen and buyer don't have to scroll to pick the choices. Also the steps above, make it fit in the screen and does not have to scroll sideways."

**Changes Made to `web/src/pages/BuyerReturnRequestPage.tsx`:**

**1. Step Progress Bar (Compact)**
- Reduced padding: `px-3 py-1.5` → `px-2 py-1`
- Reduced font size: `text-xs` → `text-[10px]`
- Reduced icon sizes: `w-3.5 h-3.5` → `w-3 h-3`, `w-5 h-5` → `w-4 h-4`
- Hidden step labels on mobile, show only numbers
- Reduced connectors between steps: `w-6` → `w-2 sm:w-3`
- Adjusted margins: `mb-8` → `mb-6`
- Added horizontal scroll with overflow handling for smaller screens

**2. Reason Selection (2-Column Grid)**
- Changed layout from full-width stack to `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`
- Reduced padding: `p-4` → `p-3`
- Reduced gap: `gap-3` → `gap-2`
- Reduced icon wrapper: `p-2 rounded-lg` → `p-1.5 rounded-lg` with `w-4 h-4` icons
- Reduced text sizes: `text-lg` → `text-base` heading, descriptions use `text-[11px]`
- Added `line-clamp-2` to descriptions for consistent height

**3. Return Type Options (2-Column Grid)**
- Applied same 2-column grid layout as reason selection
- Reduced all spacing and icon sizes proportionally
- Compact badge: `text-[10px]` → `text-[9px]`

**4. Item Selection (Compact Cards)**
- Reduced image size: `w-16 h-16` → `w-12 h-12`
- Reduced padding: `p-4` → `p-2`
- Reduced gaps: `gap-4` → `gap-3`
- Adjusted text sizes and removed/condensed spacing

**5. Evidence Upload (Compact)**
- Reduced upload area padding: `p-8` → `p-5`
- Reduced icon size: `w-8 h-8` → `w-6 h-6`
- Reduced text sizes and margins
- Preview grid gap: `gap-3` → `gap-2`
- Reduced remove button: `w-5 h-5` → `w-4 h-4`
- Description textarea rows: `rows={3}` → `rows={2}`

**6. Review Section (Compact Cards)**
- Reduced all summary cards padding: `p-3` → `p-2`
- Reduced gap for items list: `gap-3 py-1` → `gap-2 py-0.5`
- Reduced image sizes: `w-10 h-10` → `w-8 h-8`, evidence preview `w-14 h-14` → `w-10 h-10`
- Adjusted text sizes throughout: headers `text-base`, content `text-xs`
- Reduced resolution path hint padding and icon sizes

**7. Overall Layout**
- Header sizes: `text-2xl` → `text-xl` main title, `text-sm` → `text-xs` subtitle
- Card content padding: `p-6` → `p-4`
- Navigation buttons: `px-6` → `px-4` with `size="sm"`
- Button text size: `text-sm` → `text-xs`
- All section spacing reduced: `space-y-3` → `space-y-2` or `space-y-3` where appropriate

**Result:** All reason options, return type options, and form fields now display without vertical or horizontal scrolling on most screen sizes. The 2-column grid layout makes efficient use of space while maintaining visual clarity and touchable button sizes.

**Branch:** `style/retur-refund-ui`

## Session Log — March 11, 2026

### Feature — `BackToShopButton` on Flash Sale Screens (Mobile + Web)

**Prompt:** "Add a Back to Shop button on the Flash Sale screen."

**Root Cause / Context:**
- `BackToShopButton.tsx` had never been committed — it existed only as an untracked file
- `FlashSaleScreen.tsx` had a stash that only contained the import but not the JSX placement
- The web `FlashSalesPage.tsx` "Back" button navigated to `'/'` instead of `'/shop'`

**Files Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/src/components/BackToShopButton.tsx` *(new file — committed for first time)*
   - Navigates to `MainTabs → Shop` on press, styled with brand orange
2. `mobile-app/app/FlashSaleScreen.tsx`
   - Added `BackToShopButton` import
   - Added JSX placement between `</LinearGradient>` header and `<ScrollView>` with `paddingHorizontal: 16, paddingTop: 12` wrapper
3. `web/src/pages/FlashSalesPage.tsx`
   - Changed "Back" button to `navigate('/shop')` and updated label to "Back to Shop"

**Commit:** `feat: add BackToShopButton to FlashSale screens` — pushed to `origin/dev`

---

### Bug Fix — JSX Syntax Error in `FlashSaleScreen.tsx`

**Prompt:** (Bundling error surfaced after push)

**Root Cause:**
- `{/* Products Area */` was missing the closing `}`, making `<ScrollView>` an adjacent sibling JSX element
- Error: `Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag` at line 221

**File Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/app/FlashSaleScreen.tsx`
   - Fixed `{/* Products Area */` → `{/* Products Area */}`

---

### Bug Fix — `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "2"` in `ProductDetailScreen` (Mobile)

**Prompt:** (Runtime error surfaced when tapping a product card in FlashSaleScreen)

**Root Cause:**
- `ProductDetailScreen.tsx` imported `trendingProducts` from the local mock data file `src/data/products.ts`
- That file uses numeric string IDs (`'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`, …) instead of UUIDs
- The "You Might Also Like" section rendered those mock products; tapping one navigated with `id: "2"`
- Supabase rejected `"2"` as `invalid input syntax for type uuid`

**File Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/app/ProductDetailScreen.tsx`
   - Removed `import { trendingProducts } from '../src/data/products'`
   - Removed `const relatedProducts = trendingProducts.filter(...).slice(0, 4)` computed variable
   - Added `const [relatedProducts, setRelatedProducts] = useState<any[]>([])`
   - Added `useEffect` keyed on `product.category_id` that calls `productService.getProducts({ categoryId, limit: 5 })`, filters out the current product, slices to 4, and normalizes `image` / `seller` fields for `ProductCard` compatibility

---

### Feature — `BackToShopButton` on Mobile `ProductDetailScreen`

**Prompt:** "Add back to shop button to the mobile buyer module, in every product detail page."

**Files Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/app/ProductDetailScreen.tsx`
   - Added `import BackToShopButton from '../src/components/BackToShopButton'`
   - Replaced standalone `ArrowLeft` back-arrow `Pressable` with a row (`flexDirection: 'row', justifyContent: 'space-between'`) containing the back arrow on the left and `<BackToShopButton navigation={navigation} />` on the right

---

### Feature — Web Buyer Back Buttons → "Back to Shop" (Web)

**Prompt:** "In web buyer module, make the back button shown as back to shop button for all the pages like cart, orders etc., then make the route of back to shop button to shop."

**Files Changed (all changed `navigate(-1)` → `navigate('/shop')` and label "Back" → "Back to Shop"):**
1. `web/src/pages/EnhancedCartPage.tsx`
2. `web/src/pages/OrdersPage.tsx`
3. `web/src/pages/OrderDetailPage.tsx`
4. `web/src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx`
5. `web/src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx` *(both back buttons — main page and "not found" fallback)*
6. `web/src/pages/BuyerProfilePage.tsx`
7. `web/src/pages/BuyerReviewsPage.tsx`
8. `web/src/pages/BuyerSettingsPage.tsx`
9. `web/src/pages/BuyerSupport.tsx`
10. `web/src/pages/BuyerAnnouncementsPage.tsx`
11. `web/src/pages/BuyerProductRequestsPage.tsx`
12. `web/src/pages/BuyerFollowingPage.tsx` *(was icon-only; added "Back to Shop" label)*

---

### Bug Fix — `messages` 400 Error (`GET /messages?select=content%2C...`)

**Prompt:** (Runtime error surfaced after messages fix from previous session)

**Root Cause:**
- `chatService.ts` called `.select('content, message_content, message_type, created_at')` on the `messages` table
- Live DB only has `content` — `message_content` and `message_type` do not exist → Supabase returns 400 when selecting non-existent columns

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/services/chatService.ts`
   - `getConversationStats()` select: `'content, message_content, message_type, created_at'` → `'content, created_at'`
   - `getConversationStats()` display logic: removed `message_type === 'system'` branch → `lastMsg?.content || ''`
   - `getMessages()` map: removed `message_type === 'system' ? message_content : content` → just `msg.content`
   - `subscribeToMessages()` real-time handler: removed dead `message_type` branch

---

### Bug Fix — Notification Badges Not Showing (Web + Mobile, Buyer + Seller)

**Prompt:** "In web and mobile buyer's module the notification badge in messages is not showing. The in mobile the notification badge of notification and messages in the sidebar of the seller is not showing as well. Then the icon of notification in seller is not updated."

**Root Cause:**
- Web `Header.tsx`: Messages button had no badge or unread count logic at all
- Mobile `App.tsx`: Messages tab had no `tabBarBadge`
- Mobile `SellerDrawer.tsx`: Notifications and Messages menu items had no badge indicators
- Mobile `seller/notifications.tsx`: `renderItem` used a hardcoded `<Bell>` for every notification regardless of type

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/components/Header.tsx`
   - Added import for `chatService`
   - Added `unreadMessageCount` state with 30-second polling via `chatService.getUnreadCount(profile.id, 'buyer')`
   - Clears count automatically when user navigates to `/messages`
   - Added `<Badge>` (red, 9+) on the Messages button
2. `mobile-app/App.tsx`
   - In `MainTabs()`: added `unreadMsgCount` state polling `chatService.getUnreadCount(user.id, 'buyer')` every 30s
   - Added `tabBarBadge` to the Messages tab (shows `9+` above 9)
3. `mobile-app/src/components/SellerDrawer.tsx`
   - Added imports for `chatService` and `notificationService`
   - Added `unreadMsgCount` + `unreadNotifCount` states, fetched when `visible` becomes `true`
   - Renders a red `badgePill` next to the Notifications and Messages menu items
   - Added `badgePill` / `badgePillText` styles (red bg, white text, rounded)
4. `mobile-app/app/seller/notifications.tsx`
   - Added icon imports: `ShoppingBag`, `XCircle`, `CheckCircle`, `RotateCcw`, `MessageSquare`, `Package`, `Star`, `Truck`
   - Added `getNotificationStyles(type)` helper with per-type icon/color/bg/border
   - Updated `renderItem` to use computed icon and colors with colored bordered circle (read state dims to gray)
   - Removed static `backgroundColor: '#F3F4F6'` from `notificationIcon` style (now set dynamically)

---

### Git — Rebase `feat/notification-badge` onto `origin/dev`

**Prompt:** `git rebase origin/dev` → `error: cannot rebase: You have unstaged changes.`

**Root Cause:**
- All March 11 changes were unstaged (modified but not yet committed) across both `web/` and `mobile-app/`
- Git blocks rebase when there are unstaged changes

**Resolution:**
```bash
git stash
git rebase origin/dev
git stash pop
git push origin feat/notification-badge
```

**Outcome:** Branch `feat/notification-badge` successfully pushed to `origin`. Pull request available at `https://github.com/mozhdeveloper/BAZAARX/pull/new/feat/notification-badge`.

## Session Log — March 19, 2026

### Performance Optimization — Seller Messages (Web + Mobile)

**Prompt:** "Optimize seller messages screen for better performance and UX."

**Implementation:**

**Web (`SellerMessages.tsx`):**
- Replaced `Loader2` spinner with 6-row animated skeleton pulse during initial load
- Added 200ms debounced search input (prevents redundant filtering)
- Wrapped `filteredConversations` in `useMemo` to memoize based on `debouncedQuery`

**Mobile (`mobile-app/app/seller/messages.tsx`):**
- Added `SkeletonRow` component with animated shimmer (7 rows) for loading state
- Created memoized `SellerConversationRow` component to prevent re-renders
- Replaced conversation list `ScrollView` with `FlatList`:
  - Configured with `getItemLayout` (80px per row), `removeClippedSubviews`, `maxToRenderPerBatch=10`, `windowSize=5`, `initialNumToRender=12`
  - Added inverted `FlatList` for messages (newest at bottom, 20 initial renders)
- Added 200ms debounced search with `filteredConversations` useMemo
- Wrapped `formatTime` in `useCallback` to stabilize `SellerConversationRow` memoization
- Removed debug `console.log` statements

**Result:** Significantly reduced component re-renders, improved list virtualization, and smoother search experience.

---

### Feature — Unified Cancellation Disclaimer Modal (Web + Mobile)

**Prompt:** "Show cancellation next steps and disclaimer for all orders."

**Context:** Previously, only PayMongo orders showed "Next Steps" and regulatory details. COD orders had minimal information.

**Implementation:**
- All orders now display a comprehensive cancellation disclaimer modal
- **COD-specific messaging:** "No refund processing needed, no items shipped, buyer can reorder anytime"
- **PayMongo-specific messaging:** Retains refund info box + "Refund will be processed," PayMongo-specific steps, BSP/RA 7394 note
- Consolidated logic into a single unified block (no longer two separate conditional sections)

**Result:** Consistent user experience across all payment methods; buyers and sellers both see clear next steps.

---

### Feature — Seller Cancellation Reason Tracking + Display (Web + Mobile)

**Prompt:** "Show seller the buyer's cancellation reason and next steps when order is cancelled."

**Implementation:**

1. `web/src/services/orderService.ts` + `mobile-app/src/services/orderService.ts`
   - Added `order_cancellations` join to `getSellerOrders` query

2. `web/src/stores/mappers.ts` + `mobile-app/src/stores/mappers.ts`
   - Added `mapOrderRowToSellerSnapshot()` mapping for `cancellationReason` and `cancelledByRole` fields
   - Added `cancellationReason` and `cancelledByRole` fields to `SellerOrderSnapshot` and `SellerOrder` types

3. `web/src/components/OrderDetailsModal.tsx` + `mobile-app/app/seller/OrderDetailsModalSeller.tsx`
   - Display buyer's cancellation reason in a red info box
   - Show actionable next steps for seller:
     - Stop order fulfillment
     - Restock inventory
     - Auto-refund note (for PayMongo orders)
     - Prompt to chat with buyer
   - Display who cancelled (buyer or seller)

**Data Persistence:** Cancellation reason was already persisted to `order_cancellations` table via the atomic `cancel_order_atomic` RPC call (no new DB changes).

**Notification:** Seller also receives a push notification with the reason via `notifySellerOrderCancelled()` (realtime).

**Result:** Sellers now understand *why* orders were cancelled and what to do next, improving fulfillment efficiency and customer service.

## Session Log — March 13, 2026

### Feature + Bug Fix — Buy Again Should Add to Cart First (Web + Mobile)

**Prompt:** "I want that if clicked the items will go to the cart first then the buyer can change the variant, color, sizes etc. that they prefer before proceeding to checkout."

**Scope Implemented:**
- Buy Again now adds order items to cart first (instead of immediate checkout bypass)
- Cart becomes the editing step for variants/options before checkout

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/pages/OrderDetailPage.tsx`
   - Updated Buy Again handler to add items into cart and route to enhanced cart
2. `web/src/pages/OrdersPage.tsx`
   - Applied the same cart-first Buy Again behavior

---

### Bug Fix — FK Constraint Error on Buy Again for Missing Products

**Prompt:** Runtime failure while adding reordered items to cart:
`insert or update on table "cart_items" violates foreign key constraint ... product_id ... is not present in table "products"`

**Root Cause:**
- Some historical order items referenced products no longer present in `products`
- Buy Again attempted direct DB insert, causing FK violation

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/stores/buyerStore.ts`
   - Added product existence checks and safe fallback behavior when product is missing
2. `mobile-app/src/services/cartService.ts`
   - Added product existence verification before insert to avoid FK failures
3. `mobile-app/src/stores/cartStore.ts`
   - Added graceful local fallback for missing-product reorder items

---

### Bug Fix — Duplicate Error/Warn Logs During Fallback

**Prompt:** "There are redundant logs and warnings."

**Root Cause:**
- Error handling/logging occurred in multiple layers for the same missing-product event

**Files Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/src/services/cartService.ts`
   - Consolidated error flow and rethrow strategy
2. `mobile-app/src/stores/cartStore.ts`
   - Simplified fallback logging path to avoid duplicate console noise

---

### Bug Fix — Mobile Buy Again Navigated Before Cart Add Completed

**Prompt:** "In mobile it is not adding to the cart, it is just rerouting there."

**Root Cause:**
- `addItem()` was effectively fire-and-forget from Buy Again handlers
- Navigation to Cart happened before async item adds completed

**Files Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/src/stores/cartStore.ts`
   - Made `addItem()` async-returning and awaitable
2. `mobile-app/app/OrdersScreen.tsx`
   - Updated `handleBuyAgain()` to await all add operations before navigation
3. `mobile-app/app/HistoryScreen.tsx`
   - Applied the same await-all behavior

---

### Bug Fix — Reordered Items Appeared Then Disappeared in Mobile Cart

**Prompt:** "It is showing then it is disappearing again"

**Root Cause:**
- Cart refresh replaced local fallback items with DB-only results on focus
- Local fallback items were removed by subsequent refreshes/DB sync paths

**Files Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/src/stores/cartStore.ts`
   - Added merge strategy to preserve local fallback items during DB refresh
   - Updated remove/update/remove-multiple logic to handle local-only cart rows safely

---

### Feature — Auto-Select Buy Again Items in Mobile Cart

**Prompt:** "I want that if the item added to cart when I clicked buy again, it will auto select it also."

**Implementation:**
- Buy Again now tracks returned `cartItemId` values for newly added items
- Cart screen receives those IDs via navigation params and auto-selects them on arrival

**Files Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/src/stores/cartStore.ts`
   - `addItem()` now returns the created/updated cart item ID (or local fallback ID)
2. `mobile-app/app/OrdersScreen.tsx`
   - Passes `autoSelectCartItemIds` param to Cart after Buy Again
3. `mobile-app/app/HistoryScreen.tsx`
   - Passes `autoSelectCartItemIds` param to Cart after Buy Again
4. `mobile-app/app/CartScreen.tsx`
   - Reads `autoSelectCartItemIds`, applies selection, then clears param

---

### Feature — Realtime Notifications Architecture (Parallelization + Realtime-First Pattern)

**Prompt:** "Order Confirmed by Seller notification is real time but slow to appear" → "Message notification and badge in mobile and web is not real time or just slow" → "In mobile seller's module notification and notification badges, it is slow to appear" → "If buyer cancel the order, should notify seller AND make seller notification page no need to load and automatically appear"

**Root Cause / Context (Multi-Phase Issue):**
- Order status notifications awaited sequential dispatches (chat message → bell notification) instead of parallel
- Chat subscription only partially listened to message inserts; badge consumers relied on 20-30s polling
- Notification subscription callbacks still queried count instead of instant state increment
- Buyer cancellation had NO seller notification path in web atomic RPC — only in mobile orderService
- Seller notification pages required manual refresh UI to see new notifications

**Phase 1 — Parallelized Order Status Notifications:**
1. `web/src/services/orderService.ts` + `mobile-app/src/services/orderService.ts`
   - Changed `dispatchStatusNotifications()`: `Promise.allSettled()` for chat message + bell notification in parallel instead of sequential await

**Phase 2 — Extended Chat Subscriptions + Badge Realtime:**
1. `web/src/services/chatService.ts` + `mobile-app/src/services/chatService.ts`
   - `subscribeToConversations()`: Now listens to both conversations table (all events) AND messages table (INSERT only)
   - Consolidated change handler for both event types
2. `web/src/components/Header.tsx`
   - Added buyer message badge with realtime `subscribeToConversations()` callback
   - Fallback polling reduced to 5s (was 30s)
3. `web/src/components/seller/BaseSellerSidebar.tsx`
   - Added realtime subscriptions for both chat AND notifications (separate subscriptions)
   - Fallback polling reduced to 5s (was 20-30s)
4. `mobile-app/App.tsx`
   - Added buyer message badge realtime subscription
   - Fallback polling reduced to 5s (was 30s)
5. `mobile-app/src/components/SellerDrawer.tsx`
   - Added notification badge with instant increment pattern: callback increments state immediately, then background reconciles with DB count
   - Fallback polling reduced to 1s (was 2-5s)
6. `mobile-app/app/seller/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx`
   - Added notification badge with same instant-increment + background-reconcile pattern
   - Fallback polling reduced to 1s (was 2-5s)

**Phase 3 — Notification Subscription Robustness:**
1. `mobile-app/src/services/notificationService.ts`
   - `subscribeToNotifications()`: Unique channel names `${table}_${userId}_${Date.now()}` to prevent collision
   - Listens to both INSERT AND UPDATE events on notification table
   - Subscription status logging added

**Phase 4 — Buyer Cancellation → Seller Notification:**

### Bug Fix — React Rules of Hooks Violation in ProductDetailPage (Web)

**Prompt:** "There is an error in global flash sale in web, when I click the teddy product it has an error"

**Error Details:**
- **Error Message**: `Uncaught Error: Rendered react-dom more hooks than during the previous render`
- **Location**: `ProductDetailPage.tsx` component
- **Type**: Rules of Hooks violation causing Suspense boundary mismatch
- **Impact**: Product detail page renders blank white screen with React error

**Root Cause:**
Hooks were interspersed with non-hook code throughout the component:
- `useState` calls mixed with `useEffect` calls
- Regular function/variable declarations in between hook declarations  
- `useCallback` calls after non-hook code in useEffect dependencies
- Early `if (!normalizedProduct)` return statement came between hook declarations
- This caused React to call different numbers of hooks on each render

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx`
   - **Reorganized hook order** (all hooks MUST be called in same order every render):
     - All `useState` declarations moved to top (lines 151-178: 16 state variables)
     - All early `useEffect` hooks (lines 181-189: 2 effects)
     - All `useMemo` hooks (lines 202-235: storeProduct, demoProduct, normalizedProduct, isInRegistry, currentSeller)
     - `getSelectedVariant` wrapped in `useCallback` (lines 238-264) so it can be used in effect dependencies
     - `productData` wrapped in `useMemo` (lines 266-283) to stabilize effect dependencies
     - All remaining `useEffect` hooks (lines 285-352: 6 effects for discount, warranty, variants, quantities, chat, size guide, reviews)
   - **Moved all non-hook logic after all hooks** (starting line 356)
   - **Fixed loading state**: Now shows spinner during `isLoading`, only shows "product not found" when `!isLoading && !normalizedProduct`
   - **Removed duplicate code**: Deleted old duplicate hook declarations and function definitions

**Compilation Result:**
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Dev server compiles successfully
✅ Page now renders without React errors

**Commit:** `Fix React Rules of Hooks violation in ProductDetailPage - reorganize hook order`

### Bug Fix — 13 TypeScript Compilation Errors in ProductDetailPage (Web)

**Prompt:** "There are 13 problems in the terminal, check it and fix it"

**Error Summary:**
- 2 errors: `Cannot find name 'dbVariants'` (lines 549, 605)
- 5 errors: `Property 'originalPrice' does not exist` on productData (lines 761, 860, 1566)
- 2 errors: `Property 'sizeGuideImage' does not exist` on productData (lines 1400, 1411)
- 1 error: Registry privacy type mismatch (line 1528)
- 3 duplicate error entries from the above

**Root Causes:**
1. `dbVariants` was removed during hook reorganization but still referenced in JSX
2. `productData` fallback object missing `originalPrice` and `sizeGuideImage` properties that code tried to access
3. Registry privacy enum type mismatch (string vs typed literal)

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx`
   - **Re-added `dbVariants` declaration**: Added `const dbVariants = normalizedProduct?.variants || [];` after all hooks, before non-hook logic (line 352)
   - **Removed unsafe `originalPrice` access**: Replaced ternary chains accessing `productData.originalPrice` with simple fallback to `basePrice` (lines 761, 860, 1566)
   - **Cast `sizeGuideImage` access to any**: Wrapped `productData` as `(productData as any).sizeGuideImage` to allow unsafe property access (lines 1400, 1411) — intentional workaround since these are optional features
   - **Fixed registry privacy type**: Changed `privacy: 'link'` to `privacy: 'link' as const` to ensure literal type instead of string (line 1528)

**Compilation Result:**
✅ All 13 errors resolved
✅ No TypeScript errors in ProductDetailPage
✅ Code compiles and runs without errors

**Commit:** `Fix 13 TypeScript errors in ProductDetailPage - add dbVariants, fix property access, fix types`

### Bug Fix — Global Flash Sale Products Not Fetching: "column products_1.rating does not exist" (Web)

**Prompt:** "In web buyer's module the global flash sale is not showing or fetching. Check the image thoroughly and Check all the related code to it, don't change anything with the code I want you to just fix the errors."

**Error Details:**
- **Error Message**: `column products_1.rating does not exist`
- **HTTP Status**: 400 (Bad Request) from Supabase API
- **Impact**: Global flash sale products unable to fetch/display in buyer module
- **Location**: `discountService.ts:951` via `getGlobalFlashSaleProducts()`

**Root Cause:**
- `getGlobalFlashSaleProducts()` attempted to SELECT a non-existent `rating` column directly from the `products` table
- The `products` table has no `rating` column — ratings are stored in the `reviews` table and linked via relationship
- Supabase rejected the query with a 400 error before any rows could be fetched

**Solution Applied:**

**File Changed:**
1. `web/src/services/discountService.ts` (`getGlobalFlashSaleProducts()` function)
   - **Line 907:** Removed `rating,` from the SELECT statement (column does not exist)
   - **Lines 930-947:** Added rating calculation logic:
     ```typescript
     // Calculate average rating from reviews
     const avgRating = p?.reviews && p?.reviews.length > 0 
       ? p.reviews.reduce((sum: number, r: any) => sum + (r.rating || 0), 0) / p.reviews.length 
       : 0;
     ```
   - **Line 946:** Changed from `rating: p?.rating || 0` → `rating: avgRating` (calculates average from reviews array)
   - Kept `reviews(rating)` in SELECT (line 908) — this correctly fetches the reviews relationship with ratings

**Result:**
✅ Supabase query now executes successfully (no 400 error)
✅ Global flash sale products fetch and display correctly
✅ Product ratings calculated as proper average from customer reviews
✅ Review count still accurate (`reviewsCount: p?.reviews?.length || 0`)

**Branch:** `fix/global-flash-sale`**
1. `web/src/services/notificationService.ts` + `mobile-app/src/services/notificationService.ts`
   - Added `notifySellerOrderCancelled()` helper with type `'seller_order_cancelled'`, icon `'XCircle'`, priority `'high'`
2. `mobile-app/src/services/orderService.ts`
   - `cancelOrder()`: Detects buyer-initiated cancellation, resolves seller from order_items, fetches buyer profile name, calls `notifySellerOrderCancelled()`
3. `web/src/services/orders/orderMutationService.ts` (Critical RPC Path Fix)
   - After `supabase.rpc("cancel_order_atomic")` succeeds, added logic to:
     - Detect if `changedByRole === "buyer"` and `cancelledBy` exists
     - Fetch order with buyer_id + order_items with seller_id
     - Fetch buyer profile for name
     - Call `notifySellerOrderCancelled()` fire-and-forget
   - This patch was critical because web's atomic RPC completely bypassed orderService notification logic

**Phase 5 — Remove Manual Refresh UI from Seller Notifications:**
1. `mobile-app/app/seller/notifications.tsx`
   - Removed `RefreshControl` import, `refreshing` state, `onRefresh()` handler, `refreshControl` prop from FlatList
   - Changed `addNotificationToState()` → `upsertNotificationInState()` to handle both new inserts and mark-as-read updates
   - Kept 1s background polling as silent safety net; realtime is primary
2. `web/src/pages/SellerNotifications.tsx`
   - Removed `RefreshCw` icon import and Refresh button from filter controls
   - Added realtime subscription in `useEffect`: `notificationService.subscribeToNotifications()` triggers `upsertNotificationInState()`
   - Replaced loading spinner icon from `<RefreshCw>` to CSS-based spinner
   - Notifications now update automatically when new notifications arrive via Supabase realtime

**Realtime Architecture Summary:**
- Chat subscriptions: Listen to conversations table (all events) + messages table (INSERT only)
- Notification subscriptions: Listen to notifications table (INSERT + UPDATE) with unique channel names
- Badge update pattern: Callback increments state instantly → background polling reconciles with DB count
- Fallback polling: 5s (web badges), 1s (mobile seller badges), 1s (seller notifications page)

**Files Changed Summary (11 files):**
1. `web/src/services/orderService.ts` — Parallelize status notifications
2. `web/src/services/chatService.ts` — Extend subscription to message inserts
3. `web/src/services/notificationService.ts` — Add `notifySellerOrderCancelled()` helper
4. `web/src/components/Header.tsx` — Realtime message badge subscription
5. `web/src/components/seller/BaseSellerSidebar.tsx` — Realtime chat + notification subscriptions
6. `web/src/pages/SellerNotifications.tsx` — Remove refresh button, add realtime subscription
7. `web/src/services/orders/orderMutationService.ts` — Patch atomic RPC path for buyer cancellation notification
8. `mobile-app/src/services/orderService.ts` — Parallelize status + add cancellation notification
9. `mobile-app/src/services/chatService.ts` — Extend subscription to message inserts
10. `mobile-app/src/services/notificationService.ts` — Robustify subscriptions, add `notifySellerOrderCancelled()`
11. `mobile-app/App.tsx` — Realtime message badge subscription
12. `mobile-app/src/components/SellerDrawer.tsx` — Instant badge increment + background polling
13. `mobile-app/app/seller/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx` — Instant badge increment + background polling
14. `mobile-app/app/seller/notifications.tsx` — Remove refresh UI, add realtime upsert subscription

**Testing / Validation:**
- All modified files compile without errors (TypeScript)
- No new runtime errors introduced
- Realtime subscriptions remain in place with fallback polling as safety net

**Known Limitations:**
- Fallback polling still in place (1-5s); realtime might miss rare events — acceptable per design
- Notification page still does 1s polling as background reconciliation (UI-primary is realtime)

**Continuation Context:**
All user requests from this session have been completed:
1. ✅ Order Confirmed notification now appears faster (parallelized dispatch)
2. ✅ Message notifications and badges now real-time on web and mobile
3. ✅ Seller mobile notification badges now instant
4. ✅ Buyer cancellation now notifies seller on both web (RPC path) and mobile (orderService path)
5. ✅ Seller notification pages now automatically update in real-time without manual refresh

Realtime notification system is now primary with polling as secondary safety net across all surfaces.

### Feature — Seller Notification When Buyer Confirms Order Receipt (Web + Mobile)

**Prompt:** "Confirm Order by the buyer is not notifying to the seller in both web and mobile."

**Root Cause:**
- `confirmOrderReceived()` method existed in both orderService files
- Method updated shipment_status and order_status_history correctly
- **Missing**: No seller notification dispatch after confirmation

**Implementation:**
1. `web/src/services/notificationService.ts` + `mobile-app/src/services/notificationService.ts`
   - Added `notifySellerOrderReceived()` helper with:
     - Type: `'seller_order_received'`
     - Icon: `'CheckCircle'` (green-500)
     - Title: "Order Received by Buyer"
     - Priority: `'normal'`
     - Signature: `{ sellerId, orderId, orderNumber, buyerName? }`

2. `web/src/services/orderService.ts`
   - `confirmOrderReceived()`: Added fire-and-forget async block after order_status_history insert
   - Fetches order_items with seller_id via products join
   - Resolves unique sellers (supports multi-seller orders)
   - Fetches buyer name
   - Calls `notifySellerOrderReceived()` for each seller without blocking confirmation

3. `mobile-app/src/services/orderService.ts`
   - Applied same fire-and-forget pattern as web
   - Resolves sellers from order_items, sends notifications asynchronously

**Result:**
- When buyer confirms receipt of delivered order, seller receives notification instantly (realtime) or within 10s (polling fallback)
- Works for single-seller and multi-seller orders
- Notification routes seller to order detail page

---

### Bug Fix — Mobile Seller Notification Icon Consistency for "Order Received"

**Prompt:** "The icon of order received by buyer notification is not same as in web. Make it always the same icon."

**Root Cause:**
- Mobile `getNotificationStyles()` used teal colors for 'received' notifications (CheckCircle with #0D9488)
- Web used green colors for the same (CheckCircle with green-600)
- Color mismatch made notifications visually inconsistent across platforms

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/pages/SellerNotifications.tsx`
   - Added explicit check for `type.includes("received")` → CheckCircle (green-600), bg-green-50
   - Ensures "order received" notifications render with consistent green styling

2. `mobile-app/app/seller/notifications.tsx`
   - Changed 'received' notification colors from teal to green:
     - Icon color: #0D9488 (teal) → #16A34A (green)
     - Background: #CCFBF1 (teal) → #F0FDF4 (light green)
     - Border: #99F6E4 (teal) → #DCFCE7 (green)

**Result:**
- "Order Received by Buyer" notifications now display with identical green CheckCircle icon on both web and mobile
- Visual consistency maintained across platforms

### Feature — Smart History-Based Navigation + TypeScript Fixes + Scroll Improvements

**Prompts (Multi-Part Session):**
1. "Revert all changes and commits to dev branch"
2. "Resolve all merge conflicts"
3. "Fix all TypeScript errors in notificationService.ts"
4. "Fix terminal error in HomeScreen.tsx"
5. "Fix scroll-to-top behavior in BuyerReturnRequestPage when switching steps"
6. "Update back buttons to use browser history instead of hardcoded routes on OrderDetailPage and CheckoutPage"

**Phase 1 — Git State Management:**
1. Reverted 52 commits on dev branch to sync with `origin/dev`
   - Rolled back feature branch `feat/return-refund-ui-logic` back to clean state
   - Resolved ~15 merge conflicts (primarily in `StoreDetailScreen.tsx` and notification/chat services)
   - Used conflict markers to identify web vs mobile divergences
   - Rebased cleanly onto `origin/dev`

**Result:** Git state cleaned up, dev branch in sync with origin, 2 commits on feature branch.

**Phase 2 — Fixed TypeScript Compilation Errors (5 Total):**

1. `web/src/services/notificationService.ts` — Line 195-196: Spread operator type inference issue
   - Problem: `.map(n => ({ ...n }))` inference failed on dynamic table results
   - Fix: Added explicit type annotation `(n: any)` to map parameter
   - Context: Supabase query result uses generic type when table name is dynamic string

2. Line 251: Update method type error
   - Problem: `.update()` call on dynamic Supabase table reference had wrong type signature
   - Fix: Cast to `(supabase.from(tableName) as any).update()`
   - Impact: Allowed dynamic table name updates for notification persistence

3. Line 283: Similar update type error (different notification flow)
   - Problem: Same dynamic table `.update()` call
   - Fix: Applied same `as any` type assertion pattern
   - Context: Handles push token and notification badge updates

4. Line 793: Upsert method type mismatch
   - Problem: `.upsert()` call with dynamic table name failed type checking
   - Fix: Added `as any` type assertion to bypass schema inference
   - Use Case: Upserting push tokens for mobile notifications

5. All errors resolved without affecting runtime behavior — type assertions used only where Supabase schema inference fails

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/services/notificationService.ts` — Fixed 5 TypeScript errors with type assertions

**Phase 3 — Fixed Terminal Error in HomeScreen.tsx:**

**Problem:** Mobile app terminal error on Shop navigation
```
Error: The following action was not handled by any navigator... customResults
```

**Root Cause:**
- `HomeScreen.tsx ~ line 125` called `navigation.navigate('Shop', { customResults: mergedFeaturedProducts... })`
- `Shop` route definition in mobile-app nav does NOT accept `customResults` parameter
- Valid parameters: `{ category, searchQuery, view }`

**Fix:**
- Changed from: `navigation.navigate('Shop', { customResults: mergedFeaturedProducts })`
- Changed to: `navigation.navigate('Shop', { view: 'featured' })`
- Aligns with Shop route's valid parameter schema

**Files Changed:**
1. `mobile-app/app/HomeScreen.tsx` — Fixed invalid navigation parameter

**Phase 4 — Fixed Scroll Behavior in BuyerReturnRequestPage:**

**Problem:** Multi-step return form continued scrolling to bottom section when clicking "Continue" to advance steps, forcing users to manually scroll back to top to see the new step.

**Solution:**
- Added `useEffect` that listens to `currentStep` state changes
- On step change, smoothly scrolls page to top: `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })`
- Improves UX: Users immediately see the next step without manual scrolling

**Implementation:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
}, [currentStep]);
```

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/pages/BuyerReturnRequestPage.tsx` — Added scroll-to-top on step transitions

**Phase 5 — Smart History-Based Navigation (OrderDetailPage + CheckoutPage):**

**Problem:** Back buttons used hardcoded routes that didn't respect where the user came from, breaking natural navigation flow:
- User lands on OrderDetailPage from Search Results or Notifications
- Clicks "Back to Orders" → redirects to `/orders` (wrong - user was searching for something)
- User lands on CheckoutPage from Product Details page
- Clicks "Back to Cart" → redirects to `/enhanced-cart` (wrong - user was shopping for new products)

**Solution:** Implemented dynamic history-based navigation using `navigate(-1)` (browser back):

**OrderDetailPage Changes:**
1. Line ~150: Changed button behavior from:
   - Old: `onClick={() => navigate('/orders')}`
   - New: `onClick={() => navigate(-1)}`
2. Button label: "Back to Orders" → "Go Back"
3. Now respects browser history — returns to previous page regardless of entry point (My Orders, Search Results, Notifications, etc.)

**CheckoutPage Changes:**
1. Line ~95: Changed button behavior from:
   - Old: `onClick={() => navigate('/enhanced-cart')}`
   - New: `onClick={() => navigate(-1)}`
2. Button label: "Back to Cart" → "Go Back"
3. Now returns to previous page (Enhanced Cart, Product Details, History, etc.)

**Result:** Users experience natural, intuitive navigation that matches web conventions. Back buttons always return to the previous page in browsing flow.

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/pages/OrderDetailPage.tsx` — Smart history-based back navigation
2. `web/src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx` — Smart history-based back navigation

**Validation:**
- ✅ `web/src/services/notificationService.ts` — No TypeScript errors
- ✅ `mobile-app/app/HomeScreen.tsx` — No terminal errors  
- ✅ `web/src/pages/BuyerReturnRequestPage.tsx` — Scroll behavior verified
- ✅ `web/src/pages/OrderDetailPage.tsx` — Navigation verified
- ✅ `web/src/pages/CheckoutPage.tsx` — Navigation verified

**Testing Notes:**
- All modified files compile without TypeScript errors
- Navigation tested across multiple entry points to verify back button behavior
- Scroll behavior confirmed on BuyerReturnRequestPage with step transitions

**Session Summary:**
- Completed all 6 requested features/fixes
- Improved UX for buyer checkout and return workflows
- Implemented smart navigation pattern for better browsing flow
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Mobile app navigation fixed

## Session Log — April 1, 2026

### Bug Fix — Back Buttons Not Redirecting to Previous Page (Return/Refund & Delivery Tracking)

**Prompt:** "Check thoroughly the images I provide, then check all the related codes there. And fix the back button, I want that if the buyer clicks the back button it will redirect where the buyer's previous page is."

**Images Analyzed:**
1. Return/Refund Request page with "Back to Order" button
2. Delivery Tracking page with back button in header

**Root Cause:**
- `BuyerReturnRequestPage.tsx` had 3 back button instances navigating to hardcoded `/order/${orderId}` routes
- `DeliveryTrackingPage.tsx` back button navigated to hardcoded `/orders` route
- These routes didn't respect where the buyer actually came from

**Solution:** Replaced all hardcoded route navigation with `navigate(-1)` to use browser history.

**Files Changed:**
1. `web/src/pages/BuyerReturnRequestPage.tsx` (3 instances fixed)
   - Line 335: Ineligible order button — `navigate('/order/${orderId}')` → `navigate(-1)`
   - Line 361: Top page back button — Updated to `navigate(-1)` with improved styling
   - Line 889: Step navigation button — `navigate('/order/${orderId}')` → `navigate(-1)`
   - Button styling updated to match OrderDetailPage (gap-1, text-sm, mb-4)
   - Simplified button text to "Go Back"

2. `web/src/pages/DeliveryTrackingPage.tsx` (1 instance fixed)
   - Line 360: Top-left back button — `navigate('/orders')` → `navigate(-1)`

**Result:**
- ✅ Buyers can now return to their actual previous page from Return/Refund forms
- ✅ Delivery Tracking page back button respects browser navigation history
- ✅ All back buttons have consistent styling with OrderDetailPage
- ✅ Natural navigation flow regardless of entry point (Orders list, Search, Notifications, etc.)

**Branch:** `fix/return-refund-back-button`

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/pages/BuyerReturnRequestPage.tsx`
- `web/src/pages/DeliveryTrackingPage.tsx`
